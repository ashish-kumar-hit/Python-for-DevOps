1. Variables are used to store data
2. Allow us to work with data & manipulate it as per our requirement
3. Make our code more flexible and reusable.

Global & Local Variable:

Global: Decleared outside function, Anyone can access it
Local: Decleared inside some functions, we can access it within function itself only

Best Practices to declear Variables:

1. decleare variable in lower case
2. if you variable have multiple parts like ec2instancename then use underscore
3. Snake Casing: ec2_instance_name
4. Camel Case: ec2InstanceName
5. Decleare variable as descriptive as possible
n = "Ashish" (Wrong way)
name = "Ashish" (Right way)
